# Creating Parameterised Reports Using Quarto

## Abstract

When working with data, it's common to generate the same report multiple times,
each with different parameters, such as dates, datasets, or regions. Manually
updating and duplicating reports can be time-consuming and prone to error.
In this session, I will introduce parameterised reporting 
using Quarto, an open-source system for scientific and technical publishing. 
You'll learn how to automate the generation of multiple versions of the same 
report, without copying and pasting.

## Who Should Attend?

This session is ideal for anyone who works with data and produces reports. 
Basic familiarity with R will be helpful, but is not required.
